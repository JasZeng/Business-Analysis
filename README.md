# Business-Analysis
Project Name: "Thera Bank: How to make personal loan business out of existing clients?"

Project Overview:
Instead of utilizing advanced math models to solve a specific question, this project more focuses on how to address a business issue/need: from defining the business goal, to project scoping and design, to propose a DS solution and illustrate its impact hypothesis. It's all about working with real business.

1. Thera Bank project write up.docx
   Project write up/ detailed explanation
2. Thera_Personal_Loan_workbook.xlsx
